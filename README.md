Credit Card Fraud Detection

The youth of today prefer buying everything online including the smallest of the smallest item that is easily available outside. This does not require them to physically go out and buy things which results in waste of time. Many times, online trade requires bills to be paid online. Thus, tones of people engage in online transfers and bill payments which are far easier to carry out then to give away money in cash. Along with e-shopping, frauds involving online payments are on a high. Frauds are caused when some people for their selfish needs and monetary gains hack these online transfers and redirect the money to their own accounts.

The project is built to detect and analyze the fraud in the credit card transaction.

Methodologies used:
1. Support Vector Machine
2. Random Forest

Result:
The area under curve for Random Forest model is 0.9977 i.e. 99.7% accuracy is obtained. Whereas, after using SVM model, the area under curve is 0.9785 i.e. 97.8%.
This concludes that when we need to flag down correct and accurate transactions that are actually fraudulent, then the random forest is much more accurate and reliable.
